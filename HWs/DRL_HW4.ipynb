    "# HW 4 - Inverse RL & GRPO Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reward modeling is the glue between human supervision and scalable RL systems. Classical inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) lets us infer reward functions directly from expert demonstrations, and that same idea underpins modern training pipelines (r.g. RLHF, RLAIF, Constitutional AI) where we fit reward models or preference models for large language models. Even though today's top AI labs rely on pairwise/ranked preference data or verifiable rewards rather than tabular MaxEnt IRL, the maximum entropy view is a foundational recipe: it teaches us to match feature expectations while keeping the trajectory distribution as high-entropy (i.e., as uncertain) as possible away from labeled data, which is a philosophy we still enforce when training modern reward models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Section 1**, we will apply Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt IRL) algorithm from [Ziebart et al., 2008](https://cdn.aaai.org/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-227.pdf) to recover rewards from demonstrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Section 2**, we will fine-tune a QLoRA-adapted large language model with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm from [Shao et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300) so the LLM outputs follow structured reasoning formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime requirement.** This notebook assumes access to a GPU (MaxEnt IRL visualization is light, but GRPO + QLoRA fine-tuning will not run on CPU). If you are using Google Colab, open `Runtime → Change runtime type` and set the hardware accelerator to `GPU`, then restart the runtime before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conserve GPU hours, we recommend leaving the notebook on a CPU runtime while you work through Section 1 and the early GRPO setup cells. Switch to a GPU only once you reach the GRPO training section where accelerated generation becomes necessary.\n"

Your estimated rewards should have the correct top two high reward states, but expect some noise in the lower-value states due to limited demonstration data."

    "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) extends PPO for RLHF by sampling multiple responses per prompt and using their mean reward as a control variate. This stabilizes policy updates when rewards come from evaluators or heuristics--exactly the setting for aligning language and multimodal models.\n",

    "**GRPO recap (Shao et al., 2024).** For each prompt $i$ we draw a group of $m$ completions $\\{y_{i,j}\\}_{j=1}^m$ from the policy. Rewards $r_{i,j}$ are centered with the group mean $\\bar r_i = \\tfrac{1}{m}\\sum_j r_{i,j}$ to form advantages $A_{i,j} = r_{i,j} - \\bar r_i$. The policy update maximizes the PPO-style surrogate $\\min\\big(r_{i,j}A_{i,j}, \\operatorname{clip}(r_{i,j}, 1 \\pm \\epsilon)A_{i,j}\\big)$ while subtracting a KL penalty $\\beta\\,\\mathrm{KL}(\\pi_\\theta \\Vert \\pi_{\\text{ref}})$ to keep the fine-tuned model close to the frozen reference. This notebook isolates each mathematical piece so you can test it in isolation before chaining them together.\n",

The next block of cells loads libraries, defines the system & user prompts, constructs the reward function, and wires together helper utilities (log-prob extraction, grouped advantages, optimizer setup). Treat those as scaffolding so you can focus on the GRPO-specific TODOs and diagnostics. In particular, the device/import setup, dataset builder, model + LoRA configuration, and format/decoding helper cells are boilerplate—you do not need to edit them.\n",
